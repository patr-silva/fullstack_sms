<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="about">About the project</h2>

This project provides tutors with an intuitive platform to manage their students' information efficiently. Users can access a calendar displaying all scheduled lessons, view detailed information about each lesson, and perform management tasks such as updating or canceling them. The goal is to streamline lesson planning and student data management in one place.

<h2 id="goals">Goals and objectives</h2>

This application leverages a modern tech stack to deliver a scalable and efficient solution for managing student and lesson data. The frontend is built with React, styled with Bootstrap, to provide a clean and responsive user interface. The backend, powered by Spring Boot, ensures robust and flexible server-side logic, while SQL handles database management for reliable data storage and retrieval.

Planned enhancements include implementing functionality for assigning and viewing student grades.
