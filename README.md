<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="about">About the project</h2>

This app is designed to help teachers manage their students efficiently. Currently, teachers can view a list of students, update their details, and remove them if needed.

<h2 id="goals">Goals and objectives</h2>

This application is built using a modern tech stack to ensure efficiency and scalability. The frontend is developed with React and styled using Bootstrap for a clean and responsive user interface. The backend is powered by Spring Boot, providing robust and flexible server-side logic. SQL is used for database management, ensuring reliable data storage and retrieval."

Future enhancements include adding a class schedule, enabling class appointments, and allowing teachers to assign and view student grades.
